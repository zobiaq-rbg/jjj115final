                <h2>Learning American</h2>
                <pp> My parents immigrated to America from India when my mom was 26 and when my father was 30. They left their homes in northern India, their friends, their family, and the lives they knew in hopes of achieving the American dream. They can speak to sacrifice, and putting the lives and opportunities of their children over their own. My mom, who had enrolled in a PHD program in India but decided to walk away to help support my dad in moving to the US, can additionally speak to working her way through an American dream that had not necessarily been her own initially. I chose to tell their story for this final project because I am almost certain that if their story were to be told on the national stage, it would be a bestseller. </pp>

                <h2>My Parents' Story As A Book Cover</h2>
                <pp> For one of my graphics, I worked within Canva Pro to try to illustrate what I feel my parents' story as immigrants might look like as a book cover. I tried to capture the theme mentioned throughout this website of working their way from rags to riches. When my dad first moved to the US, he was working as a dishwasher, not even fully knowing English. He would do whatever he could just to get by. NOw, he works as a successful engineer and is able to be the breadwinner of the family. Similarly, my mom was able to be run the household and educate both of her kids at home to the best of her ability. She has always supported my dad and feels their successes are her own.  </pp>

My photography was of course limited due to the unfortunate circumstances surrounding COVID-19; however, I did my best to capture their daily routines and activities, such as prayer, playing chess, or working from home. </pp>

      <h2>An Interview With My Parents</h2>
                <pp> In this video, my parents share insights on their journey coming to America as immigrants. My dad first immigrated to Texas to complete his masters degree in civil engineering at Texas A and M. My moom would come join him a few months later. After a year of both having moved to the states, they had their first child, my brother. I would come along 10 years later. They share some of the lessons they learned and how they were able to find community here in the US. My mom played a supportive role to my father, always supporting him in his dreams, and then later to her children, pushing them to be the best version of themselves that they could possible be. </pp>
